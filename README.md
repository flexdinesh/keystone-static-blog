This is a starter template to build statically generate blog-like websites with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Keystone](https://keystonejs.com/).

## Getting started

WIP

The project is a monorepo with Keystone server in `keystone-server` workspace and the next frontend in `next-app` workspace.

1. `yarn` are project root installs the dependencies for both the server and the frontend app.

2. `yarn dev` starts the Keystone server at http://localhost:3000 and the next app at http://localhost:8000

_You can alternatively open two terminal tabs and run yarn dev individually within `keystone-server` and `next-app` directories.
